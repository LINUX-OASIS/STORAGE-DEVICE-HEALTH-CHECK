A simple yet powerful Bash script that provides a Text-based User Interface (TUI) to quickly check the S.M.A.R.T. health status of your NVMe and SATA/SCSI storage devices.

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI**: Uses `whiptail` to present a clean, interactive menu for easy device selection.
*   **Automatic Device Detection**: Scans and lists available NVMe (`/dev/nvme*`) and SATA/SCSI (`/dev/sd*`) drives.
*   **Dependency Auto-Installer**: Checks for required tools (`nvme-cli`, `smartmontools`) and attempts to install them if they are missing.
*   **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed health reports using `nvme smart-log` and `smartctl`.
*   **Quick Summary View**: Displays a concise summary of the most critical health attributes in a dialog box.
*   **Report Logging**: Saves the full and summary reports to the `/tmp` directory for later review.
*   **Colorful Output**: Uses `tput` and `whiptail` themes for a more readable and visually appealing experience in the terminal.

## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

This script is designed to work on Debian-based Linux distributions that use the `apt` package manager. It has been tested and is known to be compatible with:

*   !Debian
*   !Ubuntu
*   !Linux Mint
*   Other Debian/Ubuntu derivatives.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The script requires the following command-line tools to function correctly:

*   `nvme-cli`: For interacting with NVMe storage devices.
*   `smartmontools`: For querying S.M.A.R.T. data from SATA/SCSI devices.
*   `whiptail`: For displaying dialog boxes from shell scripts (typically pre-installed on most Debian-based systems).

> **Note**
> The script will automatically check if `nvme-cli` and `smartmontools` are installed. If they are not found, it will attempt to install them using `sudo apt install -y`. You may be prompted for your password.
